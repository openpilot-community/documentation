# Introduction
This is a community document repository.
It will house all questions people ask an we will keep variants of those questions from Slack as much as we can.

When a merge is done to master, travis.ci will build the book and publish it to the web so that Google searches will be improved and people will be more likely to find answers they're looking for quickly.

## Submit a document
To submit a document, simply create it right in GitHub under the relavant section of the `src` directory.

I will try to add groupings that make sense so everyone knows where things go.

## What can a document represent?
A document should always be as small as possible.
Do not over explain.
If it's a question that hasn't been submitted, submit it quickly so it gets indexed and we can reference those links later when people continually ask them.

Short and sweet.

### Example time
*In slack, you notice someone asked this:*

    I'm taking my vehicle in for service ... is there an easy way to remove the giraffe?
  
You simply create a new md file in `src/faq` with a relatively useful but not too long name such as `how-to-remove-giraffe.md`

With the following content:

```
Q: I'm taking my vehicle in for service ... is there an easy way to remove the giraffe?

A: From the back of the griaffe, go up from the bottom, there is a tab to depress, giraffe slides out
```

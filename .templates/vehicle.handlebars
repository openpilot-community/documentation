{{#if isUpstreamed}}
The {{ FullName }} was upstreamed to the [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) repository and generally means it is a compatible / supported vehicle for openpilot.

We recommend you connect to the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai) and double check to see how well it is supported for your liking.
{{/if}}
{{#if isInDevelopment}}
The {{FullName}} is currently in early development and may not be fully supported just yet.
It is not currently available in the official [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) version of openpilot just yet.

We will continue to update this page as things progress.
{{/if}}
{{#if isInTesting}}
The {{FullName}} is currently in active testing within the community 
and a pull request has been made for it to be merged into the official [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) repository.

Although a pull request has been made, this does not mean it will be officially supported or upstreamed to the primary code base.
It might become community supported long-term.

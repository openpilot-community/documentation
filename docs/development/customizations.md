# Customizations
Recently a lot of folks are interested in customizing Openpilot in one way or another.
We would like to begin organizing these ideas so people can easily find them and make use of them if they desire.

Although some things will never be supported by Comma.ai, Inc. They're kind enough to opensource their libraries to us so we can make them work for us and possibly even contribute new features and inspiration back to them.

That being said, starting it off here.

## Driving UI
The first and seemingly most popular request is showing more statistics / information on the screen as you're driving.
This code is not available in the core codebase and has been added by various community members.

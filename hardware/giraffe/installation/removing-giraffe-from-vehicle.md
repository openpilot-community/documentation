# Removing Giraffe from Vehicle

Removing Giraffe is usually not necessary, but if you feel the need to remove it for whatever reason, here is a quick guide.

* From the back of the Giraffe
* Follow it up from the bottom
* There is a tab to depress
* Giraffe slides out

We've found that using a flat head screw driver gently to reach the tab it tends to just pop right out with very light pressure.

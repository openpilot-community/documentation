# Toyota

The goal is to always support as many vehicles as possible.

Openpilot is compatible with *some* **Toyota** model(s) so feel free to browse the support pages for these models below for additional specifics.

To chat about Toyota's with the community, checkout the # channel in the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai).

## Compatible Models

This is the current list of models being tested and/or actively supported by either community members or Comma.ai.  Varying levels of support / testing are being done on the listed models so please review them thoroughly.

## How to add support for a vehicle

If you own an unsupported vehicle but are interested in discussing porting it to openpilot, join us in the *NEW* [openpilot community chat support system](https://spectrum.chat/openpilot) and the always popular [Comma.ai Slack](https://slack.comma.ai/) if you prefer it.

There will also be some great info on porting models in [Development Guides](../../development/guides/).

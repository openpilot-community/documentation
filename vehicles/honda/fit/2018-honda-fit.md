# 2018 Honda Fit w/ Honda Sensing

The 2018 Honda Fit is currently in active testing within the community 
and a pull request has been made for it to be merged into the official [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) repository.

Although a pull request has been made, this does not mean it will be officially supported or upstreamed to the primary code base.
It might become community supported long-term.

## Compatibility

### Longitudinal Control

Openpilot has longitudinal control (acceleration and braking) over the 2018 Fit.

### Lateral Control

Openpilot doesn't currently have lateral control (steering) over the 2018 Fit.
The community appears to be working on a solution to lateral control.

## EON Mounting

We do not have a recommended mount yet, we will update when we find that.

## Recommended Hardware

If you're confident your vehicle matches the specifications above, these are some things you may need to get started.

* 1 x [EON](/hardware/eon/)
* 1 x [Panda](/hardware/panda/)
* 1 x [Giraffe](/hardware/giraffe/)

## Comma Pedal

This vehicle has not been tested with Comma Pedal as of yet but it could possibly benefit from having one.
